It empowers ordinary people to create exceptional content without knowing how to code or learning complex interfaces. You can create content with Fred by merely dragging Elements from a sidebar and dropping them where you wish for them to appear. Select the copy you wish to change or click an image you want to update, edit directly in your browser, and click a green checkmark to save the changes. What does Fred do for developers and site builders? Fred helps theme builders break into the MODX ecosystem. It is easy to port existing themes to Fred and export them ready for the MODX Extras . Fred offers existing MODX developers an option to create more flexible and intuitive experiences for their site owners. Fred can power designs that would otherwise require dozens of TVs, a complex Manager UI, or tricky Manager customization. Fred brings content creators familiar visual controls like sliders, toggles and color pickers. Further, these controls can pass parameters to MODX Snippets and its API for a bulletproof and powerful content creation solution. In short, Fred makes constructing complex pages simple for even the most non-technical users. How is Fred different from other visual content builders? Fred adheres to MODX\u2019s core tenet of Creative Freedom. It doesn\u2019t force you into someone else\u2019s preferred front-end framework or way of building things. If you can imagine or prototype it, Fred can power it\u2014without compromise. Developers and designers can realize pixel-perfect websites and confidently turn over content creation duties without fear of things breaking. So whether a site is made by customizing a free starter theme, or handcrafted 100% from scratch, Fred can help everyone build websites faster, more consistently and with better results. What Else Can Fred Do? The following is a sample of Fred\u2019s capabilities that make it a compelling visual content building platform: Transform static Design Libraries into a live content creating tool that strictly adheres to brand standards, and that is easily understood and used by non-technical team members across your entire organization Use optional conditional/looping Twig template logic to create robust Elements limited only by your imagination Create and organize collections of Elements as building blocks for pages Blueprints provide \u201creplace the placeholders\u201d full- or partial-page templates Multiple dropzones for complete control of every page layout Configure content using a variety of controls including toggles, text inputs, date pickers, select inputs, sliders, Resource pickers, and color pickers Supports MODX code Snippets with live Ajax rendering of changes Visual Font Awesome 5 icon picker\u2014developers can create other icon pickers, too Simple content formatting with a curated default TinyMCE rich text editor Rearrange and re-order page content via drag-and-drop Quickly duplicate existing Elements to build up galleries and sliders Fred content renders down to cachable output for blazing-fast page speed Complete set of production-ready Bootstrap 4 Elements to slash the time needed for theme builders to get started","title":"What is Fred?"},{"location":"#what-is-fred","text":"Fred is a visual drag-and-drop fr ont-end ed itor for MODX CMS .

They are a collection of one or more Elements with sample content and images in place. You can also use Blueprints as demo pages which theme users can use to start a site with complete layouts made up of any combination of content and Elements. Blueprints are organized into user-determined categories such as Headers, Landing Pages, Galleries, etc. Using Blueprints Like Elements, find a Blueprint you wish to use and drag-and-drop it into a Dropzone on a Fred-enabled page. Creating Blueprints Users with permissions to do so can save Blueprints and share them with others or keep them private so only their users can see them. Use cases for private Blueprints include testing by theme creators (since they won\u2019t be included in exported Themes), saving specific combinations and settings for Elements that only you will use, and end users currating frequently used Blueprints acros categories into a single location.

As such, Fred allows users to author content without having to learn the Manager, interacting with content as it will show on the page. This visual, drag-and-drop experience is considered more intuitive and easy to learn by many. Websites powered by Fred can co-exist with traditional MODX Manager controlled pages, but Fred-powered pages must be edited from the Fred UI. When logged into a site as a Fred editor, you will see several circular icons overlaid on the page that give you access to the Fred controls: When hovering parts of a Fred-enabled page, you will see sections highlighted with a blue border. These are the Elements used to create the page. The name of the Element used for that section will show in on the bottom left when hovered, and positioning and settings controls will be at the bottom-right: Users will frequently interact with the Sidebar, accessed by clicking the main MODX icon. Depending on how the site owners or developers have Fred configured, these main Fred controls will be located in one of the corners on the page. The \u201cSite\u201d menus is like the Manager tree, but only shows Fred-enabled pages. The \u201cBlueprints\u201d menu gives you the ability to create and use Blueprints . The \u201cElements\u201d menu gives you access to use Elements to construct or add to a page. The \u201cSettings\u201d menu is where page settings are configured, similar to what is in the MODX Manager for scheduled publishing, menu options, advanced settings, URL alias, and pagetitle/longtitle/etc. The \u201cMore\u2026\u201d menu gives users access to opening the page in the Manager, a link to the documentation, an optin to disable Fred, and a the ability to logout and view the site exactly as a normal site visitor would. The \u201cPreview\u201d icon (eye) shows the page under a top bar with a responsive site preview simulator with phone, tablet and full desktop responsive views. The \u201cClose\u201d icon (x) closes the sidebar, returning it to the initial Fred-loaded 4-circles state. The \u201cSave\u201d icon (check mark) saves the page. Elements Elements are the basic building block of Fred. These can be as simple as a headline, or much more complex like a complete product layout used in an e-commerce store. When logged into a site as a Fred editor, hovering parts of the page will highlight sections with a blue box, the boundary of the Element itself. Elements are configured by Option Sets which are accessed by clicking the gear icon then the \u201cOpen Settings & Plugins\u201d in the lower-right of the Element when hovered. Elements can be duplicated or used more than one time on Fred pages. Element Controls When hovering an Element, a set of positioning controls at the bottom, with a gear icon for the Element's settings appears in the lower-right. The Option Set menu is generated from a JSON text array managed through the Fred Third-party Component . Settings Menu Trigger The Option Sets attached to an Element are revealed by clicking the gear icon, just above the position conrols. Settings Menu The Settings Menu allows users (with appropriate permissions to perform several actions on an Element): Take a screenshot of the current state of the Element used when creating themes Create a partial Blueprint based on the current state of the Element Open the Settings panel for configuring the Element Duplicating the Element immediately after the current one Delete the Element from the page Position Controls Elements can either be dragged into position by using the grip icon in the middle of the poisition controls, or click the up or down arrows to move them up or down on the page. Fred vs Traditional MODX Templates What sets Fred apart from traditional MODX templates is the lack of reliance on Template Variables (TVs) for creating complex page layouts. This brings the benefit of greater simplicity and possibly faster performance without sacrificing the flexibility that TVs brought to MODX in the first place. In Fred, TVs are often replaced by Option Sets , and can be an effective substitue in many cases without the added complexity and database overhead of TVs. The current limitation for Option Sets is that they can only contain text values, so they only best used for things like text, textarea, richtext, numbers, etc. Where TVs make sense in Fred TVs still have a place in Fred for pages that require the use of MIGX or Google Map marker TVs. TVs also are also useful for segregating content into searchable vs non-searchable in your site. For example, things in a [[*sidebar]] TV could be omitted from search results with the parts of the page in the [[*content]] field still searched. What replaces TVs In Fred, Option Sets can effectively replace many use cases that previously would have required TVs in the MODX Manager. Option settings are the controls that appear when you click the gear icon for each MODX Element on a page. The gear icon also gives content authors and editors access ot the typical MODX page settings like scheduled publishing, show/hid from menu, etc. Option Sets can contain multiple items that previously would have required dedicated TVs such as toggles for enabling different layout options, text or richtext inputs, sliders to set numbers, color pickers, Font Awesome icon choosers, image uploaders, and more.","title":"Fred for Existing MODXers"},{"location":"fred_for_existing_modxers/#fred-for-current-modx-developers","text":"Fred is a visual drag-and-drop content editor that can minimize or eliminate the need for daily content authors and editors to use the MODX Manager.

It acts as a CLI tool, like Composer, for working with MODX. While this document may seem intimdating at first, it really is a simple copy/paste command line exercise. Things you\u2019ll need to access or be familiar with: A Github Account Basic command line SSH skills (optional, but easier to follow this) A MODX Cloud account, or a host that supports git Getting Started For the purpose of this tutorial, we\u2019re assuming you will use MODX Cloud. Start by creating a blank MODX instance using the latest version. You\u2019ll also need to ssh into your site to set up Gitify. Step 1: Install Composer and Gitify Once the instance is created, ssh into it and execute the following commands starting in the home directory. This will install Composer and copy Gitify to your site. cd www; curl http://modx.co/scripts/install.sh | sh mkdir ../gitify; cd ../gitify git clone https://github.com/modmore/Gitify.git ./ Now exit the SSH session, and log back in so you can use Composer. Alternately, you can use a command like source /paas/cXXXX/.profile , replacing the cXXXX with your actual Cloud directory. Step 2: Set up Gitify From an SSH connection in the Cloud home directory: cd ~/gitify composer install chmod +x Gitify; cd ~/.bin; ln -s ../gitify/Gitify gitify After the composer install command you can confirm things worked if you see a green line of text that says \u201cGenerating autoload files\u201d. Again, log out of the SSH session so you use Gitify, or use the source\u2026 command above. Step 3: Get the Clone URL For the purposes of this tutorial, we\u2019ll use a hypothetical (but non-existant) Example Theme. To get the URL to clone, on github.com find the repository you wish to work on, and click the down-arrow on the green Clone or download button and choose the SSH URL, like git@github.com:modxcms/example.git To start a new Theme project, see the Setting up a Theme to work with Gitify guide. Step 4: Clone the Shared Theme to your MODX Instance Because you cannot git clone into a directory with anything in it, we\u2019ll use a temporary location and move the files to the web root. To get the URL to clone, click the down-arrow on the green Clone or download button on a Theme Github project and copy the SSH URL which looks like git@github.com:modxcms/fred-theme-starter.git cd ~/www git clone git@github.com:modxcms/fred-theme-starter.git tmp This will download the theme repository into a ~/www/tmp/ directory in the Cloud. Next, move the contents of tmp/ to the correct location under www/ : rsync -av ./tmp ./ Make sure the .git/ directory and files are move under www/ . Once you confirm things are in the right place, go ahead and remove tmp/ : rm -rf ./tmp Step 5: Load the Theme using Gitify Now it\u2019s time to load the Theme into your MODX instance. This will most likely include several Extras and take a a minute or longer depending on the speed of your connection. You\u2019ll see messages about downloading and installing Extras during this process: cd ~/www gitify package:install --all gitify build You should see a green one-word message Done! if the install is successful, and the same but with memory and timing stats if the build is successful. Step 6: Login to the Manager to view your Theme When done you can log in to your Manager and see the Extras, including Fred, which were installed, and review the Elements, Bluprints and Options contained in the Theme.

You do this by forking the repo, making changes in a feature branch in your fork, then submitting the PR to the original project. For the purpose of this tutorial, we\u2019ll fork the Fred Starter Theme which is intended to be a Bootstrap 4 quickstart for theme builders. Start by signing into Github. Fork and clone to a MODX instance To start with PRs, you need to fork a repository and work on feature branches before you can submit PRs successfully. 1. Fork a repository Fork the repository you wish to contribute to on Github: For example, visit the Fred Theme Starter and click the fork button in the upper right. Click the down-arrow on the green Clone or download button on a source Github project and copy the HTTPS URL which looks like https://github.com/modxcms/fred-theme-starter.git for use later. You\u2019ll also need your fork\u2019s SSH URL, found in the same location, for example git@github.com:your_username/your-fork-name.git . 2. Clone your fork to your MODX instance Because git clone only works in empty directories, we\u2019ll use a temporary tmp/ directory and move the files to the web root when done. Open an SSH connection to your working Cloud instance and execute: cd ~/www git clone git@github.com:your_username/your-fork-name.git tmp This will download the theme repository into a ~/www/tmp/ directory in the Cloud. Next, move the contents of tmp/ to the correct location under www/ : rsync -av ./tmp ./ Make sure the .git/ directory and files are moved under webroot www/ directory. Once you confirm the files and directories are in the right place, go ahead and remove the tmp/ directory with rm -rf ./tmp . 3. Add the upstream remote This is the original project. Use its HTTPS clone URL from step 1 of this tutorial to set the remote upstream: git remote add upstream https://github.com/modxcms/fred-theme-starter.git Working with your fork Syncing is important, but how you sync depends on the state of your work: if you have made changes that have not been pushed, or if you are syncing ahead of starting work (no changes). No changes: Sync the upstream remote to your fork For the purposes of working with PRs, you should never commit directly to your master branch; for more information see the Feature Branches and Pull Requests: Walkthrough and Understanding the GitHub flow guides. Before pushing any work to a feature branch, you should sync your local repository with the upstream. For more information on syncing forks see the Syncing a fork guide: git checkout master git fetch upstream git merge --ff-only upstream/master # only merges if local is clean git push origin master # push to your fork gitify package:install --all gitify build These commands are only needed when there is a differnce between the commit version in the upstream remote and your local fork. It will not hurt to run them every time though. Local changes: Sync the upstream remote to your fork The following commands create your local feature branch, and commits them to the local git repo. cd ~/www git checkout -b my-feature # checkout to a new branch named `my-feature`, # or any other name you decide for your work gitify extract # extract all your local changes git add --all # or git add only specific changed files git commit -m \"My Changes\" # Use a more reasonable commit message Next, we sync upstream master branch with your fork. git checkout master git fetch upstream git merge --ff-only upstream/master git push origin master Now, we sync the feature branch with any changes from the master branch of the fork from the previous merge step. git checkout my-feature # checkout your `my-feature` branch again git rebase master # this pulls from your forked master``` This may result in conflicts that will be noted. If there are conflicts, they must be resolved before you can continue. A conflict happens when two people change the same line of code. For information on resolving conflicts, please see Github\u2019s guide to resolving conflicts . Finally, we build all the changes into your working MODX instance with Gitify. gitify package:install --all gitify build Double check to make sure the Theme and the changes still work as expected. Then commit them to your Github fork, where it can then be submitted as a PR to the original upstream project: git push origin my-feature # push to your `my-feature` branch on Github to # submit as a PR, per the next section below git checkout master # return to the master branch to start your next gitify package:install --all # restore the `master` state to your local MODX gitify build Now submit the PR to the upstream project. Submit a PR to the upstream project Open your fork on Github. There should be a notification about creating a PR from newly created branch.

You can make Fred as open or restricted as you want when it comes to controlling the layout of a page. It is possible to just limit Fred to a set content area, similiar to how you would use an RTE currently. Tips Here are some tips for converting your site to Fred. Default Element When converting existing pages to Fred, you will want to specify a Default Element in the Themes grid, see documentation . Without a default element set, your content will disappear when switching a resource to Fred. The Default Element works by detecting there are no Fred elements currently in place, then selecting the default element and putting any content from the resource into the object specified by the data-fred-name option. Templates Generally, you will want to create a new template or duplicate an existing template when converting content to Fred. This way you can maintain a hybrid and not potentially break content during the transition. Themes One important note about themes is that multiple Templates can be specified per theme, but if a Fred resource is changed to a Template with a different theme, it has the potential to lose its elements.

To start creating a theme, follow the steps below: Install Fred from MODX.com , the icon picker and TinyMCE RTE Set up a MODX Template with a content Dropzone Assign this Template to a Fred Theme Create Categories for your Fred Elements Create Fred Elements Step 1: Install Fred Fred is available as a transport package. In your MODX installation, go to Extras > Installer and click on the Download Extras button. Search to find bring up Fred. You should also see other Extras listed made for Fred, such as a Font Awesome icon picker and a TinyMCE RTE. If you decide to add these also, follow their setup instructions. After your Fred Extras finish downloading, install them from the Packages grid. Step 2: Set up a Template Fred needs a \u201cdropzone\u201d to know where content can go, indicated by adding a data-fred-dropzone attribute to an HTML entity, often a div tag. For example, where the [[*content]] tag would normally be in a Template, add the following: <div data-fred-dropzone=\"content\"> [[*content]] </div> Note the value of the data-fred-dropzone=\"content\" attribute indicates where to render your content once you save a page in Fred, in this case, the [[*content]] . Fred also supports multiple Dropzones; see the templates documentation for more information. Step 3: Assign a Template to a Fred Theme In the MODX Manager, go to the Extras menu > Fred > Themes tab and switch to Themed Templates sidebar Click the Assign Theme to a Template button Select all Templates you wish to use with this Fred Theme Select the Default Theme Click the Save button In the Manager, Resources that use Templates assigned to a Fred Theme should have an \"Open in Fred\" button. From the front-end, you should see either three icons which launch Fred at the bottom-left of the page or a Fred sidebar. Step 4: Create Categories for Elements Fred organizes Elements using categories. Open the Elements Manager Page from the Extras > Fred > Elements menu, and switch to the Categories tab to create Categories. For example, your categories could look like this (create these for the purpose of this demo): Page Content Intros Text Images Testimonials \u2026 Fred requires at least one Category before creating actual content Element. Step 5: Create your first Elements Fred Elements can be as simple as raw text or more complex like a responsive product catalog detail page. Let\u2019s start by creating a simple heading Element, often the first thing on a page. Switch to the Elements tab in Element\u2019s CMP ( Extras > Fred > Elements ) and click the Create Element button. Fill the name ( H1 Heading ), category ( Blocks ), image ( https://placehold.it/300x150&text=H1+Heading ). Add the following markup: <h1 data-fred-name=\"heading\">H1 Heading</h1> Save this Element, go back to the front-end of your Resource, and refresh the page. Click on the orange Elements stacked boxes icon or the MODX icon in the launcher at the bottom left of the page. In the sidebar Elements tab, you should now see the categories you created earlier in step 4. Hover the Text category to see your freshly created H1 Heading Element and drag it into the empty dropzone. Your browser does not support the video tag. Congratulations, you just added your first Element to a page using Fred! Select the placeholder \u201cHello, world.\u201d text and start typing to edit its content. When hovering over an Element, you\u2019ll see an additional toolbar that lets you duplicate, delete, or move the Element on your page. When you\u2019re happy with the new page title, click the green checkbox button to save.

What makes up a Theme Themes are made of of multple things: About Fred Themes What makes up a Theme Default Element Elements Blueprints Templates and TVs Categories Extras Assets License, Changelog and Readme Files Build a Theme to Share When you create a Theme, Fred will automatically create a directory named for the theme in assets/themes/{{theme-name}} . Use this to store all your theme-specific assets like images, css, fonts and javascript. IMPORTANT NOTE: As of 1.0, Fred currently does not support exporting Media Sources. If you have used them in your Theme, please include instructions on setting them up in your README file. Default Element The default element setting allows you to chose a default Fred Element and target area for placing the content on existing documents. The setting is formatted as ID|target where ID is the identification number of the Fred Element and the target is the HTML object within containing a data-fred-name attribute. This is useful for converting a standard resource to Fred, as it will place the existing content in the default element. If you aren't finding the identification number of the Fred Element, right-click on the top of the element grid and make sure the ID column is selected. Elements A Theme Builder will automatically include all Element Categories attached to the Theme with all their Elements . All Option Sets and RTE Configs attached to the Theme will be also included. Blueprints A Theme Builder will automatically include public Blueprint Categories attached to the THeme with all their public Blueprints . Templates and TVs A Theme Builder will include all MODX Templates assigned to the Theme. Any TVs assigned to those MODX Templates will also be included. Categories A User can select any root MODX Category to be included with the Theme. The Theme Builder will then include all child categories, snippets, chunks and plugins assigned to the root or child category. Extras Extras are MODX packages required for your theme to be fully functional. User will need to install all of the listed extras, before he can proceed with installing your Theme. Fred itself will always be a dependency and is included by default. Assets Theme-specific assets like CSS/SASS/SCSS, images, JS and other similar files are packed into each theme in the assets/theme/{{your-theme-name}} directory.

This attribute cannot be empty and must be unique within an Element. While you can create an unlimited number of Dropzones, more than a few might become cumbersome and fragile. Good use cases for multiple Dropzones includes alternate layouts like full width, split pages, pages with sidebars, etc. Example <div data-fred-dropzone=\"left\" class=\"left-content\"></div> <div data-fred-dropzone=\"right\" class=\"right-content\"></div> data-fred-name This is a unique name for each Element, the contents of which should be editable. Elements with this attribute will be saved and processed by Fred. By default, Elements with a data-fred-name attribute are automatically editable by end users, unless a contentedtiable=\"false\" is explicitly declared (see next). The value of this attribute has to be unique in each Element, but you can have multiple instances of an Element on the page and different Elements can share common data-fred-name attributes without problem. Note: Because Fred wraps all Elements in a <div> , you cannot currently use Fred to build elements that would break HTML validation such as table rows, list items, definition lists, etc. This will be solved in a future release. Examples <!-- Simple editable paragraph --> <p data-fred-name=\"description\">Default value</p> <!-- Editable image --> <img src=\"http://via.placeholder.com/450x150\" data-fred-name=\"header-image\"> data-fred-editable When set to false the content inside of the HTML Element will not be editable for end users, including any nested Dropzone content. This attribute only works when used with data-fred-name . Example <p data-fred-name=\"description\" data-fred-editable=\"false\" data-fred-target=\"description\">The value from the description field goes here</p> data-fred-attrs Defines other HTML attributes (comma separated) to save with the content of the HTML element where supported by the editor, such as alt and title attributes with images. Example <img src=\"http://via.placeholder.com/450x150\" alt=\"Default Alt\" data-fred-name=\"header-image\" data-fred-attrs=\"alt,title\"> data-fred-render This allows developers to create user-friendly, self-documenting Elements that inform users what they need to do in order to create content. When set to false these Element only appear when Fred is active. Example <p data-fred-render=\"false\" class=\"editor-instructions\">Add a *Link Location* setting for this Element to make a call to action button appear. (This block is only visible when using Fred.)</p> data-fred-target This defines the Resource field or TV in which to store content. Content of the Element will be stored in regular Content field and additionally in the specified target. This attribute can\u2019t be used on a dropzone. Available targets: pagetitle longtitle description introtext menutitle alias Template Variables (TVs) Note: using TV targets only stores in text or textarea inputs only, as the actual data is stored as a JSON object. As such, some TV input types defined in the MODX Manager such as select inputs, Google Map Markers, etc., will not work. All TV names must be prefixed with tv_ in order to save to a TV. Examples <h1 data-fred-name=\"title\" data-fred-target=\"pagetitle\">Default Page Title</h1> <h1 data-fred-name=\"my-tv\" data-fred-target=\"tv_job-title\">Targets the \"job-title\" TV field</h1> data-fred-rte If set to true the Rich Text Editor will be loaded for editing the content inside this Element. Example <div data-fred-name=\"rte-content\" data-fred-rte=\"true\">Default Content</div> data-fred-rte-config This is useful when you need a limited or expanded set of rich text editor controls than provided by the default configuration, allowing you to specify an overriding alternate RTE config than the default RTE config. Example <div data-fred-name=\"rte-content\" data-fred-rte=\"true\" data-fred-rte-config=\"bold-and-italics-only\">The RTE for this content will only show the bold and italics buttons</div> data-fred-media-source This option defines a specific Media Source for Elements, using the names of one or more Media Sources, separated by commas for all file types. Example <a href=\"assets/pdfs/brochure.pdf\" data-fred-name=\"brochure\" data-fred-media-source=\"Assets\">download our brochure</a> data-fred-image-media-source Identical to data-fred-media-source but only for images. Example <img src=\"http://via.placeholder.com/450x150\" data-fred-name=\"header-image\" data-fred-image-media-source=\"Blogs,Images\"> data-fred-block-class Allows you to specify an additional class which is added to the wrapping div.fred--block added around Elements when Fred is loaded. This can be useful when JavaScript libraries or CSS styling techniques require specific wrapper classes. When Fred is not loaded, the attribute will be added to the classes of the element itself. Example Element Markup: <div class=\"image\" data-fred-block-class=\"special-wrapper\"></div> When Fred is loaded, the markup around it will look as follows: <div class=\"fred--block special-wrapper\"> <div class=\"fred--toolbar\">\u2026</div> <div class=\"fred--block_content\" data-fred-element-id=\"5ce33419-44d6-4e30-90db-8c9a62d04763\" data-fred-element-title=\"Image\"> <div class=\"image\"></div> </div> </div> When Fred is not loaded, the processed markup for the element will look as follows: <div class=\"image special-wrapper\"></div> data-fred-class The value of this attribute will be added to class for this element only when Fred is not loaded. Example Element Markup: <div class=\"row\" data-fred-class=\"visible-grid foo\"></div> When Fred is loaded, the class is omitted: <div class=\"row\"> \u2026 </div> When Fred is not loaded, the class is added: <div class=\"row visible-grid foo\"> \u2026 </div> data-fred-bind This allows you to bind the value of another part of the page to another location within one Element. Example Element Markup: <div data-fred-name=\"name\" data-fred-render=\"false\">John Doe</div> <div class=\"modal\"> <div class=\"modal-header\" data-fred-bind=\"name\"></div> <div class=\"modal-content\">Hello there</div> </div> Rendered HTML: <div class=\"modal\"> <div class=\"modal-header\">John Doe</div> <div class=\"modal-content\">Hello there</div> </div> data-fred-on-drop The name of a globally-accessible JavaScript function to be called when the Element is dropped into any Dropzone. The function will receive fredEl as its first attribute. You can use this to trigger a JavaScript function, for example, calling a slider initialise script that you normally have document.ready function call. Without using this attribute, you would need to save and reload the page to initialise the newly dropped slider item. Example <div class=\"clock\" data-fred-on-drop=\"initClock\"> data-fred-on-setting-change The name of a globally-accessible JavaScript function to be called when an Element setting changes. The function will receive fredEl as its first attribute. Example <div class=\"clock\" data-fred-on-setting-change=\"reInitClock\"></div> data-fred-link-type data-fred-link-page Used by the TinyMCE RTE with a data-fred-link-page attribute to create links in the MODX format of [[~2]] . These links are processed into the href target before generating content. Example <a href=\"fred.html\" data-fred-link-type=\"page\" data-fred-link-page=\"2\">Fred</a> data-fred-min-height Applicable for dropzones. When set, the value used in this attribute will be set in the dropzone's style min-height. Example <div data-fred-dropzone=\"content\" data-fred-min-height=\"50px\"></div> data-fred-min-width Applicable for dropzones. When set, the value used in this attribute will be set in the dropzone's style min-width.

Any Resource using a template listed in that table will block access to the Content area in the Manager and load Fred on the front-end when logged in for editing. Dropzones Most templates will have a content Dropzone. Fred also supports multiple Dropzones for things like sidebars, headers, footers, or any other purpose you need. In your Fred Templates, you need to define where Dropzones will be by using data-fred-\u2026 attributes with HTML. Simple Fred Template Example with One Dropzone <html> <head> <title>[[*pagetitle]]</title> </head> <body > <div data-fred-dropzone=\"content\" data-fred-min-height=\"500px\"> [[*content]] </div> </body> </html> The default minimum height for a dropzone is only 5 pixels, which may be a bit small to target. If you wish to have a larger \u201cempty\u201d default state, add a data-fred-min-height=\"250px\" setting with your desired minimum height. A larger minimum height on a dropzone can make it easier to target for dropping Elements when empty. The size of your min-height might also need to change if you have competing or overlapping Elements, such as a fixed top navigation bar. The dropzone\u2019s data-fred-dropzone=\"content\" attribute is required and tells it where to save the rendered Fred content. It also needs to contain a reference to the [[*content]] tag inside of it. When Fred loads, it clears out the content rendered in the dropzone, and loads it with Element data. However, when Fred is not loaded, it just renders whatever tags you have in that area. Multiple Dropzones Sometimes you may want to have a more complex layout with multiple Dropzones, like for a main content area and a sidebar. Fred installs a new Template Variable type for this purpose: Fred Dropzone . To create another dropzone do the following: From the MODX Manager, navigate to the Elements sidebar tree > Template Variables drop-down list > + circle icon to create a new TV Give the TV a name, such as \u201csidebar\u201d and assign it to a Fred category From the Input Options tab choose \"Fred Dropzone\" from the Input Type select list If you want to see the rendered content from the Manager, change the value of the last \u201cHide Field from Manager:\u201d option to \u201cNo\u201d.
